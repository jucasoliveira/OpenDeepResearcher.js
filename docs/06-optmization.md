# Optimization Tips

To improve the performance and responsiveness of the Automode Research Agent, here are some key optimization strategies:

## 1. **Use Vector Stores for Memory**

Store past queries and results in a **Vector Database** (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, Redis). This will reduce redundant searches, improving speed and accuracy.

## 2. **Optimize API Calls**

Instead of searching multiple sources in parallel for every query, consider implementing a **priority-based system** where the agent searches the most reliable sources first.

## 3. **Reduce the Number of Tools**

Keep the number of tools in the LangChain agent to a minimum. More tools can increase the execution time, so only include essential tools like search, analyze, and compose.

## 4. **Rate Limit Requests**

For scalability, rate-limit incoming requests to ensure that the server can handle the load without breaking.

## 5. **Cache Results**

Cache frequently requested queries to avoid hitting the web search APIs repeatedly. This can significantly improve response times for common queries.

## 6. **Use Pre-built Search APIs**

Instead of building custom search APIs, leverage pre-existing solutions like **Google Custom Search API** or **Bing Search API** to save time and resources.
