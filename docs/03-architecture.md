### Architecture Overview

# Architecture Overview

The **Automode Research Agent** is structured as a multi-step process, with different components handling specific tasks such as search, analysis, composition, and fact-checking. Below is the architecture breakdown:

## Components

1. **LangChain Agent**: This is the core component responsible for handling the flow of actions based on the query.

   - **Search**: Uses an API call to fetch results based on the user's query.
   - **Analyze**: Processes search results for insights and key information.
   - **Refine**: Improves the search query if results are unsatisfactory.
   - **Compose**: Generates a well-structured article based on the analysis.
   - **Fact-Check**: Verifies the generated content for accuracy before finalizing.

2. **Server-Side**: We use either **Fastify** or **Next.js** to handle the server-side logic.

   - **Fastify**: Handles real-time streaming of results as they are generated.
   - **Next.js**: Uses API routes for interacting with the LangChain agent.

3. **Vector Store (Optional)**: A memory component for storing past queries and results, enhancing search relevance.

## Tools Used:

- **LangChain.js**: For handling agents, tools, and LLMs.
- **Fastify/Next.js**: For server-side request handling.
- **OpenAI API**: For using GPT models (e.g., GPT-4) to generate and analyze content.
- **Vector Store**: For storing past search results and improving efficiency.
